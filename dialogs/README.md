## Dialogue Format

All dialogues follow this format:
```
[S1] Speaker 1 says something analytical and informative...
[S2] Speaker 2 responds with curiosity or questions.
[S1] Speaker 1 provides more details, you know... with natural pauses.
[S2] That's fascinating! Tell me more about it.
```

## Generation Process

1. **Content Analysis**: Claude analyzes the source article
2. **Personality Assignment**:
   - S1: Analytical, informative, provides context
   - S2: Curious, reactive, asks clarifying questions
3. **Natural Speech Patterns**:
   - Filler words ("well", "you know", "I mean")
   - Pauses indicated by "..."
   - Conversational flow
4. **Content Coverage**: Ensures all key points are discussed

## Example Prompt Structure

```python
prompt = f"""
Transform this content into a conversational podcast between two speakers using [S1] and [S2] tags.

Article Title: {title}
Article Content: {content[:8000]}...

Target Duration: {duration_minutes} minutes (~{target_exchanges} exchanges)

Guidelines:
- Natural conversation, not a script
- Add pauses with "..." and commas
- Include filler words for naturalness
- Cover all key points
- Make complex topics accessible
